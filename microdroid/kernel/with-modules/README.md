# Microdroid kernel with modules

This directory contains prebuilts of the Microdroid kernel with support for
loading vendor modules. Only arm64 architecture is supported.

NOTE: the prebuilt was generated on a local machine, and can only be used on
development devices.

NOTE: this feature is WIP and kernel is subject to change.
